## Notes

This case is still developing. The market has not resolved. If Rieder is nominated:
- Wallet will profit ~$270K+ (total value if YES = $1.00)
- Would confirm insider access to Trump administration Fed Chair deliberations
- Pattern matches other government policy insiders (Maduro, FOMC)

If Rieder is NOT nominated:
- Position becomes worthless
- Similar to MutualDelta false positive (Iran strikes)
- But trading pattern still suggests pre-knowledge attempt
