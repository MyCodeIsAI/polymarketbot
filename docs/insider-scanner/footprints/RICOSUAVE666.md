## Intelligence Assessment

### Why This Pattern Is Critical

1. **Military operations are classified:** Exact timing requires intel access
2. **100% win rate statistically improbable:** Random chance ~0.8% for 7/7
3. **Exact day predictions:** Beyond public information analysis capability
4. **Consistent dormancy:** Only activates when operation imminent
5. **Evasion behavior:** Suggests awareness of wrongdoing

### Possible Information Sources
- Government/military insider (US, Israel, or ally)
- Signals intelligence access
- Diplomatic communication intercepts
- Defense contractor with operational knowledge
